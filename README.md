# Bachelor Thesis
My Bachelor thesis at Vilnius Tech in 2020. A website about Lithuanian castles and forts using Google Maps API

In my bachelor thesis, I mostly focused on APIs, APIs history, security, compared selected Map APIs (Google Maps API. MapQuest Open API, ArcGIS API for JavaScript, OpenLayers, TomTom, MapBox, HERE) and their usage.

The design can be found: https://www.behance.net/gallery/106659671/Bachelor-Thesis
